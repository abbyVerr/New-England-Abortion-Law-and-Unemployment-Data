"KFF analysis of state policies and court decisions, as of November 24, 2025."

"Definitions"
"*Viability* is the point when a fetus can survive outside the womb and is generally presumed to occur at around 24 weeks gestation. However, viability has never been properly defined by courts and"
"depends on the individual pregnancy and on various factors, including gestational age, fetal weight and sex, and medical interventions available. "
""
"*LMP*: Calculates the beginning of pregnancy from a women's last menstrul period. States that do not explicitly enumerate the manner in which gestational age should be determined are labeled as ""LMP"" in keeping with standard medical practice."


Footnotes
"1. Fetal viability varies from person to person and also by the medical resources that are offered in their community, but is generally estimated to be at around 24 weeks LMP."
"2. The sexual assault must be reported to law enforcement for the rape/incest exception to apply in these states."
"3. Idaho's 6-week LMP limit has a reasonable medical judgment standard, but the Idaho Supreme Court [has ruled](https://law.justia.com/cases/idaho/supreme-court-civil/2023/49615.html) that the good faith judgment standard controls the state ban's life exception."
"4. State law imposing a 6-week LMP abortion ban temporarily blocked by courts."
"5. State requires a second physician to attend an abortion that takes place after the state’s gestational age limit. Minnesota requires the presence of a second physician at or after 20 weeks LMP."
"6. State law imposing a total abortion ban temporarily blocked by courts."
"7. Virginia imposes a statutory limit on abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy; the third trimester starts at 27 weeks and is after fetal viability."
"8. The attorney general is challenging the pre-Roe abortion ban."
